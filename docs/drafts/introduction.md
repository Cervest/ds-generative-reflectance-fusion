# General motivation

- Amid climate variability induced impact on land resource management, Earth observation data has become increasingly important. In particular, decision making on agricultural issues can greatly benefit from airborne crop monitoring.

- Satellites sensors capture terrestrial surface reflectance at various spatiotemporal resolutions.

- In general a trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution is faced. Sensors with large scanning swath cover wide regions at once, resulting in a poor spatial resolution, but tend to have a great revisit frequency. Inversely, sensors with higher spatial resolution can scan tighter regions, providing finer views, but take longer to revisit a given site.

- Landsat mission in particular, provides imagery at a 30m spatial resolution appropriate for agricultural monitoring tasks such as crop growth monitoring and land-cover change detection. However, its 16-day revisit cycle and frequent cloud occulting hampers its potential for applications.

- On the other hand, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor offers an interesting daily revisit cycle at the expense of a much coarser spatial resolution of 250m for red and near-infrared (NIR) bands (1-2) and 500m for other optical bands 3-7.

- By combining Landsat fine-resolution acquisitions with MODIS coarser daily update, one can aim to overcome limited access to free high spatial and temporal resolution data.
