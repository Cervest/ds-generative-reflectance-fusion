# General motivation

- Amid climate variability induced impact on land resource management, Earth observation data has become increasingly important.

- Airborne remote sensing devices capture terrestrial surface reflectance at various spatiotemporal resolutions.

- However, in general a trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution is to encountered. Sensors with large scanning swath cover wide regions at once, resulting in a poor spatial resolution, but tend to have a great revisit frequency.

- On the other hand, sensors with higher spatial resolution scan tighter regions, providing finer views, but take longer to revisit sites.

- Landsat data in particular, has a 30m spatial resolution suited for monitoring agricultural development. However, its 16-day revisit cycle and frequent cloud occulting hampers its use.

- Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, on the other hand offers a daily revisit cycle at the expense of a much coarser spatial resolution of 250m for red and near-infrared (NIR) bands (1-2) and 500m for other bands 3-7.
